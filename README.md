# 🎮 **Fiyuu**

Fiyuu is a game in which we manage a catapult as the main character and try to neutralize enemies inside structures like in Angry Birds.
The game has 3D graphics, physics-based puzzle genre and contains 10 levels. 
I made this game as a final project in the last year of my university and completed it as a demo game.
